# üöÄ **Pico Train** but with **ReLoRA**

**Pico Train** is a minimalistic framework for training language models‚Äîfrom tiny 1M-parameter models to mid-scale 1B‚Äîwhile automatically storing **rich checkpoints** (including activations and gradients) for **in-depth learning dynamics research**.

Our **suite of pre-trained models** is already publicly available on our [Hugging Face organization](https://huggingface.co/pico-lm), and a dedicated companion library for advanced analysis‚Äî[**pico-analyze**](https://github.com/pico-lm/pico-analyze)‚Äîis fully released for deeper checkpoint studies.

> For a **detailed run-through**, check out the **full tutorial** on our website at [picolm.io](https://picolm.io).

## **Key Features**

1. **Pico Decoder: LLAMA-style Transformer Architecture**  
   - RMSNorm, RoPE, multi-head self-attention with KV-cache, and SwiGLU activations  
   - Currently supports the **pico-decoder** model, with future expansions planned (pico-diffusion, pico-statespace, etc.)

2. **Comprehensive Checkpoints**  
   - Saves model states, optimizer states, and training metadata  
   - Enriched with **activation and gradient** snapshots for interpretability  

3. **Focused Scale Range**  
   - Optimized to train models from **1M to 1B parameters**, where learning dynamics research is often most viable  

4. **Clean, Pre-tokenized Data**  
   - Uses the curated [Pretokenized-Dolma](https://allenai.org/dolma) dataset, available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/pico-lm/pretokenized-dolma)  
   - Identical data order ensures **consistent** training across model sizes  

5. **Research Ready**  
   - Minimal, well-documented code suitable for **forking and tailoring**  
   - Logs essential metrics (e.g. perplexity) throughout training  
   - Works seamlessly with [pico-analyze](https://github.com/pico-lm/pico-analyze) for advanced post-training interpretation

## **Training Philosophy**

All models in the Pico suite (both pre-trained and user-trained):

- Employ **identical architectures** and **optimizer settings**  
- **Share** the same data order and tokens  
- Automatically log **rich checkpoint data** (including activations, gradients)  
- Facilitate **direct cross-scale comparisons**

This uniformity means you can isolate model size as the primary variable, giving you clearer insights into **how model capacity affects learning**.

## üì¶ Resources

All our pre-trained models and datasets are publicly available through our [HuggingFace organization](https://huggingface.co/pico-lm):

- Pre-trained models (1M to 1B parameters)
- Pre-tokenized training data derived from the DOLMA corpus
- Training checkpoints with activation and gradient information
- Basic evaluation (perplexity) metrics logged throughout training

## üåü Why Pico?

Unlike other model suites, Pico is specifically designed for learning dynamics research:

1. **Focused Scale Range**: Covers the critical 1M-1B parameter range where most learning dynamics research is feasible
2. **Consistent Training**: All models see identical data in identical order, enabling true cross-scale comparisons
3. **Rich Analytics**: Automatic saving of activations and gradients for mechanistic interpretability
4. **Research Ready**: Minimal, well-documented code designed to be forked and modified
5. **Clean Data**: Uses a curated, pre-shuffled version of the DOLMA corpus
6. **Train Your Own**: Simple pipeline for training your own suite of models with custom configurations

## üîë Key Features

- **Simple Architecture**: Clean, modular implementation of core transformer components
- **Educational Focus**: Well-documented code with clear references to academic papers
- **Research Ready**: Built-in tools for storing and studying model learning dynamics
- **Efficient Training**: Pre-tokenized dataset and optimized training loop
- **Modern Stack**: Built with PyTorch Lightning, Wandb, and HuggingFace integrations

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components

- **RMSNorm** for stable layer normalization
- **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)** for position encoding
- **Multi-head attention** with KV-cache support
- **SwiGLU activation** function
- **Residual connections** throughout

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone Project**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rdiehlmartinez/pico.git && cd pico
```

2. **Configure Environment**

   Create a `.env` file at the root with your Hugging Face and Weights & Biases tokens:

   ```bash
   export HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   export WANDB_API_KEY=your_wandb_key
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   source setup.sh
   ```

   This script checks your environment, installs necessary tools, and sets up a Poetry virtual environment.

4. **Train Your Model Suite**

   - Edit (or create) a config file (e.g., `configs/demo.yaml`) to specify your architecture and training preferences.
   - Then run:

     ```bash
     poetry run train --config_path configs/demo.yaml
     ```

   - This launches training, automatically checkpointing states and saving learning dynamics data.

5. **Explore Checkpoints**
   - By default, checkpoints are stored under `runs/YOUR_RUN_NAME/checkpoints/`.
   - Each checkpoint contains:
     - **Model state** (PyTorch + Hugging Face formats)
     - **Optimizer state**
     - **Gradients and activations** for interpretability
     - **Evaluation logs** (e.g. perplexity) and metrics

## **Advanced Analysis with Pico Analyze**

For deeper checkpoint analysis‚Äîcomparing gradients, tracking representation shifts, measuring sparsity‚Äîuse our companion repository [**pico-analyze**](https://github.com/pico-lm/pico-analyze). It automatically processes **pico-train** checkpoints and applies advanced metrics like **CKA**, **PWCCA**, **Gini**, **Hoyer**, and more to reveal **how** your models learn over time.
