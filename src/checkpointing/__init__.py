"""
Pico Checkpointing Package

We subdivide the checkpointing into training and evaluation, and learning_dynamics. Training
checkpoints store the model, optimizer, and learning rate scheduler. Evaluation checkpoints store
the evaluation results. Learning dynamics checkpoints store activations and gradients used for
learning dynamics analysis.
